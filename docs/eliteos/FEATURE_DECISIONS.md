# eliteOS Feature Decision Log

**Purpose:** Short, dated decisions so **non-technical stakeholders** and **future engineers** understand **why** the system behaves a certain way without reading the entire git history.

**How to add a row:** Append a new `### N. Title` block with Date, Decision, Why, Impacted files/docs, Revisit trigger.

---

### 1. Public Quote Tool pricing base

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | Public consumer material pricing uses **ESF Direct $/sqft** plus **25% public planning markup** (not legacy prototype partner $/sqft as the public base). |
| **Why** | Align public “planning” numbers with internal Direct economics + a single clear markup layer; avoids mislabeling prototype partner tiers as retail. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | `backend-core/src/quotes/quoteCalculator.js` (`ESF_DIRECT_PRICE_PER_SQFT`, `computePublicConsumerEstimatesByGroup`), `app-quote/src/lib/prototypeQuoteMath.ts` (`ESF_DIRECT_TIER_RATES`), `app-quote/src/lib/publicConsumerParity.ts`, `docs/quote-platform/pricing-seed-map.md`, `docs/quote-platform/quote-math-test-cases.md`, this blueprint §8. |
| **Revisit trigger** | Finance changes Direct sheet; new markup % policy; or public structure moves to per-org rules without code change path. |

---

### 2. Public display rounding

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | Public-facing **tier totals** (and related display fields) round **up** to the nearest **$10**; **no cents** in homeowner-facing totals. Exact values may remain in API for audit. |
| **Why** | Cleaner homeowner UX; avoids false precision; Monday and pipeline can align on the same rounded headline for Promo. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | `backend-core/src/quotes/quoteCalculator.js` (`roundPublicEstimateToNearestTen`, `enrichPublicConsumerEstimatesForDisplay`), `app-quote/src/lib/publicEstimateDisplay.ts`, `app-quote/src/ui/PublicQuoteWizard.tsx`, `docs/eliteos/SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` §8. |
| **Revisit trigger** | Product asks for different rounding (e.g. nearest $50) or to show cents for legal/compliance. |

---

### 3. Monday Quote Amount source

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | **Monday Quote Amount** (and `quote_headers.grand_total` for public consumer) uses **Group Promo only**, using the **rounded public** Promo total — **not** max tier, not average across tiers. |
| **Why** | Single headline number for CRM and pipeline; Promo is the “starting at” tier; avoids double-counting multi-tier comparison. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | `backend-core/src/quotes/quoteRoutes.js` (`persistQuoteSubmission`, `buildPublicConsumerSnapshot`), `backend-core/src/integrations/mondayQuoteSync.js` (payload `quote_total`), this blueprint §8–9. |
| **Revisit trigger** | Sales asks for “selected tier” after customer picks a material; or CRM requires max-tier column separately. |

---

### 4. Public calculate legacy payload

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | Public **`estimates_by_group`** always comes from a **legacy aggregate payload** (`countertopSqft`, `backsplashSqft`, `addOns`, `engine: "legacy"`) even when the UI used guided layout or cabinet length — the **client collapses** measurements to those fields before API calls. |
| **Why** | Backend calculator supports room engine separately; public tier matrix API is stable on legacy aggregates. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | `app-quote/src/ui/PublicQuoteWizard.tsx` (`buildCalcPayload`), `backend-core/src/quotes/quoteRoutes.js`, `docs/eliteos/SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md` §7, `.cursor/rules/quote-platform.mdc`. |
| **Revisit trigger** | Backend adds first-class `estimates_by_group` for room engine with same response contract. |

---

### 5. Monday sync non-blocking

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | Monday sync **must not** fail the public HTTP submit; persistence succeeds first; Monday is best-effort with partial diagnostics. |
| **Why** | Never lose a lead because of CRM latency or column misconfiguration. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | `backend-core/src/integrations/mondayQuoteSync.js`, `backend-core/src/quotes/quoteRoutes.js`, `docs/quote-platform/monday-public-quotes-setup.md`. |
| **Revisit trigger** | Product requires hard failure when Monday is down (unlikely). |

---

### 6. Moraware Admin prerequisite for SaaS Moraware

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | **Moraware Admin / Integration Mapping Head** is **required** before Moraware-driven features are treated as **multi-tenant reusable** (mappings org-scoped). |
| **Why** | Raw Moraware IDs differ per shop; without admin mapping, code would hardcode Elite-only assumptions. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | `docs/eliteos/eliteOS-master-head-map.md`, this blueprint §10, future `docs/eliteos/` Moraware pages when created. |
| **Revisit trigger** | First external fabricator needs Moraware sync. |

---

### 7. User-facing product name

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | **User-facing product name** is **eliteOS** (not “eOS”) in new copy, public sites, and customer-facing docs. Technical `eos` / `eOS` may remain in repo identifiers until a deliberate rename project. |
| **Why** | Brand clarity for homeowners and fabricators; reduce confusion with generic “EOS” acronyms. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | New/edited marketing and wizard copy; `docs/eliteos/*`; `.cursor/rules/eliteos-architecture.mdc`; root `README.md` may still mention eOS historically — update opportunistically. |
| **Revisit trigger** | Full rebrand ticket closes legacy naming. |

---

### 8. Internal Quote Tool v1 testing phase defaults and workflow

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | **Internal quotes** (`quote_source: internal_quote`) are **saved in the shared quote database** via authenticated **`/api/internal-quotes/*`** routes, **scoped by organization** where `quote_headers.organization_id` exists, and may **sync to a separate Monday board** using **`MONDAY_INTERNAL_QUOTES_BOARD_ID`** and **`MONDAY_INTERNAL_COL_*`** env vars. Internal material pricing supports **Direct vs Wholesale** basis without applying the **public 25%** homeowner markup. **Public** consumer calculate/submit and **public Monday** behavior remain unchanged. |
| **Why** | Staff need a shared quote library, traceable saves, and CRM routing distinct from public retail leads; math guardrails keep public and internal economics separated. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | `backend-core/src/quotes/internalQuotesApi.js`, `backend-core/src/quotes/quotePersist.js`, `backend-core/src/quotes/quoteCalculator.js`, `backend-core/src/integrations/mondayQuoteSync.js`, `app-internal-estimate/`, `docs/quote-platform/internal-quote-test-plan.md`, `docs/quote-platform/monday-internal-quotes-setup.md`. |
| **Revisit trigger** | Quote statuses finalized; Moraware writeback; partner portal quote DB; RLS tightening; reps/branches move to admin tables. |

---

### 9. Public Quote Head vs Internal Estimate Head (separate deployables)

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | **Public Quote Head** and **Internal Estimate Head** are **separate heads**. **Internal Estimate** requires **login** (Supabase session) and **Brain authorization** (`requireAuth` + `requireHeadAccess` on `/api/internal-quotes/*`). It **must not** be exposed through the **public** quote app (`app-quote` is **public-only**; internal estimate UI lives in **`app-internal-estimate/`**). |
| **Why** | eliteOS architecture uses distinct surfaces per audience; combining public and internal modes in one head risks accidental exposure of Direct/Wholesale economics and internal CRM routing. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | `app-quote/` (public wizard only), `app-internal-estimate/`, `docs/quote-platform/quote-heads-split-plan.md`, `docs/eliteos/SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md`, `docs/eliteos/eliteOS-master-head-map.md`, `docs/quote-platform/internal-quote-test-plan.md`, root `package.json` (`eos:check:local`). |
| **Revisit trigger** | SSO / device policy for staff-only hosting; or consolidation into a monorepo shared package without merging heads. |

---

### 10. Pricing Admin as long-term pricing source of truth

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| **Date** | 2026-05-11 |
| **Decision** | **Pricing Admin** is the **long-term source of truth** for quote pricing configuration (material tiers, add-ons, policy rules, future partner tiers). **Hardcoded constants** in `quoteCalculator.js` remain **authoritative fallbacks** until resolver parity tests pass and a deliberate cutover is recorded. |
| **Why** | Authorized admins must change rates and rules without code deploys; quotes must keep **snapshots** of the pricing used at save time. |
| **Impacted files/docs** | `app-pricing-admin/`, `backend-core/src/quotes/pricingAdminHeadApi.js`, `backend-core/src/quotes/pricingConfigResolver.js`, `backend-core/supabase/eliteos_pricing_admin_foundation.sql`, `backend-core/src/auth/eosGovernanceConstants.js` (`pricing_admin` head), `docs/eliteos/SYSTEM_BLUEPRINT.md`, `docs/quote-platform/pricing-seed-map.md`, root `package.json`. |
| **Revisit trigger** | After foundation SQL is applied in Supabase; when calculators read resolver first; partner tier launch; branch/account-specific pricing. |
